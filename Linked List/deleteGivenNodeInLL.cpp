// Delete given node in a Linked List : O(1) approach

// PROBLEM LINKS:
// LEETCODE: https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/
// CODE STUDIO: https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/1105578


// INTUTION: We are given access to nodes that we have to delete from the linked list. 
// So, whatever operation we want to do in the linked list, we can operate in the right part of the linked list from the node to be deleted. 
// The approach is to copy the next nodeâ€™s value in the deleted node. Then, link node to next of next node. 
// This does not delete that node but indirectly it removes that node from the linked list.


// Time Complexity: O(1)
// Reason: It is a two-step process that can be obtained in constant time.

// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Reason: No extra data structure is used.
